# Shortest-Path
# Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The graph is represented using the `Node` and `Graph` classes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main classes:

1. **Node Class:**
   - Located in the `Node.java` file.
   - Represents a node in the graph.
   - Contains methods to manage adjacent nodes, distances, and shortest paths.

2. **Graph Class:**
   - Located in the `Graph.java` file.
   - Represents a graph and provides methods to add nodes and edges.
   - Uses the `Node` class to create and manage nodes in the graph.

3. **DijkstraAlgorithm Class:**
   - Located in the `DijkstraAlgorithm.java` file.
   - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in the graph.
   - Includes the main method for user input and interaction.
